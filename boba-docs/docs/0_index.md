# Introduction

Boba is the first scaling infrastructure that is deployed on multiple blockchains, making it the leading Web3 multichain execution layer with scaling capabilities to facilitate more functionality on EVM-compatible blockchains.

Boba Network is a multichain layer 2 optimistic rollup that aims to unlock the potential of rollup technology and enable interoperability between blockchains and the real world. The protocol is fully compatible with EVM-based tools and has already deployed multichain support for Ethereum and BNB, supporting lightning-fast transactions and lower fees. It also enables visionary developers to build hybrid dApps that connect people to the future of blockchain applications.
