# Introduction to Pyth

Pyth Network price feeds provide real-time financial market data to smart contract applications on 50+ blockchains. Pyth's market data is contributed by over 95 [reputable first-party data providers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world. Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation) of these prices multiple times per second. The protocol offers over [450 price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) covering a number of different asset classes, including US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.
