# Testnet Faucets

Faucets are tools for developers that give you free ETH (and other tokens) on test networks like Sepolia and Boba Sepolia. This lets you send transactions and make smart contracts for testing. Below, you'll see a list of working faucets to use. Each faucet might ask you to prove who you are in different ways, so you might need to try a few to find one that works. Sometimes, faucets might run out of ETH. If you can't get ETH from one, just try another.
